        <p>Hello! My name is Fulu Tshilande and I am from Soweto, South Africa. I enjoy learning how to code, making new friends, 
          cycling ,playing chess and playing soccer.If I could have any superpower, it would be to speak any language so I could connect with anyone in the world.The first car I ever owned was a mini cooper (2004).I am married to a wonderful sister and together we have three amazing little ones. 
        Our first born is in grade 5a, our second born is in grade 4 and our last born is 2 years old turning 3 in August 2024.
        My track record  shows my willingness and determination to empower myself with experience and knowledge.
        I enjoy  challenges and that is the reason for my determination and drive.I love serving in the church. I  have found that it helps me feel the Saviour's love.</p>

      <p>South Africa is a beautiful destination for safari activites. Table Mountain, one of South Africa's most iconic natural wonders, stands majestically above Cape Town, its flat-topped silhouette dominating the skyline. 
        This colossal sandstone massif, with its distinctive plateau, rises nearly 1,100 meters (3,600 feet) above sea level. 
        Its flat peak spans approximately 3 kilometers (2 miles) in length, providing breathtaking panoramic views of the city below, the Atlantic Ocean, and the surrounding landscapes..</p>
