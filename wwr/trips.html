                <h3>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely, this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age.</p>
